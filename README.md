# Explanation

This project uses TKinter to launch a fake GUI of VapeV4. It is a static image, put on a non-resizable frame. It can be dragged from any point, including inside the window. This has no real use, except for tricking people, and will probably not be usefull on its own, unless you just want to troll.
